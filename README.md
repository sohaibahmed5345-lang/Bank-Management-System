## Project Overview

The **Bank Management System** is a Java application that simulates the essential operations of a real-world bank. It allows authorized users to manage clients and system users, process banking transactions, review activity logs, and perform currency conversion operations.

The project provides two interfaces that share the same business classes and data files:

- **JavaFX GUI** for graphical interaction.
- **Console UI** as an additional command-line version.

> **Academic Notice:** This project was developed for learning and course assessment purposes. It is not intended for production banking use.

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Classes and Objects** | The project uses meaningful classes such as `User`, `BankClient`, `Currency`, `Screens`, and `BankFxApp`. |
| **Encapsulation** | Fields are private or protected and are accessed through methods, getters, and setters. |
| **Inheritance** | `User` and `BankClient` inherit shared personal information from `Person`. |
| **Abstraction** | `Person` is an abstract class containing the abstract method `getRoleDescription()`. |
| **Polymorphism** | `User` and `BankClient` provide different implementations of `getRoleDescription()`. |
| **Composition / Usage** | UI classes use business and helper classes such as `FileStorage`, `Permission`, `Util`, and `AppSession`. |
| **Enumeration** | `SaveResult` represents the possible results of save operations. |

## Main Classes

| Class | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Main` | Entry point for the Console version. |

| `Currency` | Handles currency lookup, rate updates, and conversion. |
| `FileStorage` | Reads, writes, and appends text-file data. |
| `Permission` | Stores and checks permission constants. |
| `AppSession` | Stores the currently authenticated user. |
| `Input` | Provides validated Console input. |
| `ConsoleUI` | Provides Console formatting helpers. |
| `Util` | Provides encryption, date, and formatting utilities. |
| `SaveResult` | Represents the result of save operations. |

## Data Persistence

The application stores and loads data from the `data` directory. The information remains available after the program is closed.

| File | Stored Data |
|---|---|
| `BClients.txt` | Client and bank account records. |
| `BUsers.txt` | User credentials and permissions. |
| `Currencies.txt` | Currency names, codes, and exchange rates. |
| `LoginRegister.txt` | Login activity records. |
| `TransferLog.txt` | Money transfer records. |

> Do not delete or rename the `data` folder while running the project.
